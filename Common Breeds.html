                    <br>
                    Labrador retrievers were originally bred in the UK as gun dogs in the 1890s, from Canadian fishing dogs. They are 
                    medium sized dogs, weighing around 30 kg, and they come in three main colours: yellow, chocolate/liver, or black. <br>
                    There are two main breeding lines: show and working, and they have differences in appearance. Show dogs are stockier, 
                    with fuller faces and less energetic temperaments. Working lines are leaner with longer faces and require more stimulation. 
                    Both lines are excellent swimmers, helped by their waterproof coats and webbed toes, which also help them in snowier climate.<br>
                    Because of their friendly and calm nature, Labradors are frequently used as therapy dogs, whilst their intelligence and loyalty
                    makes them ideal dogs for use in the Armed Forces and the police. Their biggest health risk is obesity, with over 25% of all 
                    Labradors in the US being classed as overweight. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that they are often motivated by food, 
                    and that they are very happy to be lazier than is good for them. <br>Over 40,000 registrations of Labradors were made with the UK 
                    Kennel Club in 2020.  </td>

                    <br>
                    Cocker Spaniels are small dogs, originally bred as gun dogs to flush the birds into the air. There are two lines to 
                    this breed: English and American. The American line is smaller and with a smaller head, while the English line is 
                    taller and narrower. Within the English line, there is an additional strain of working cockers. The first mention of 
                    reference to this breed is in 14th century writings (written as “spaynels”), and the English line was first recognised
                    by the Kennel Club in 1892. The breed is certainly well-established. <br>
                    Cockers can have a variety of colours, from all black to all white, passing through tricolor on the way. They weigh
                    around 15 kg. Their ears can be long and folded, which makes the breed more prone to ear infections. The average 
                    lifespan of the breed is well over 10 years. <br>
                    In 2020 there were 25,000 registrations of cocker spaniels with the Kennel Club. </td>

                <td><h2 id="french">French Bulldog</h2>
                    <br>
                    French Bulldogs are the result of crossbreeding between toy bulldogs in the UK and local ratters in Paris in the mid 
                    1800s. Pre 1835, these dogs were originally used for blood sports such as bull baiting, but when these games were 
                    outlawed the bulldogs then became companions. Terriers were then added to the breed, bringing with them the long 
                    straight ears. They are stocky and compact and with a mild and friendly personality. According to the American Kennel
                    Club, the breed should be muscular, with a smooth, wrinkly coat, a large head, bat ears, and should weigh around 13 kg.
                    Colours can be brindle, fawn, cream or a combination of the above. <br>Because of the breeding as companions, French
                    bulldogs are very people orientated, which can make them prone to separation anxiety, although it makes them much
                    easier to train. Their short legs make it difficult to get out of bodies of water, so even though they love to swim,
                    they have been known to drown after falling into pools. <br>Because of their huge rise in popularity, selective breeding has caused
                    this breed to be disproportionately affected by some health issues, including airway obstructive syndrome and ear 
                    infections, and their single layer thin coat makes it impossible for them to regulate their temperature – heat 
                    strokes are not uncommon. Their average lifespan is around 10 years. <br>In 2020, there were just under 40,000 French 
                    bulldogs registered with the Kennel Club in the UK.
