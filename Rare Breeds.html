                    <br>
                    Komondors (also known as the Hungarian sheepdog, or mop dogs) were bred (and are used) as livestock guardians. The oldest 
                    reference to this breed is in the Hungarian codex in 1544, and in the 20th century were declared a Hungarian National 
                    Treasure, making them protected from modification. They are related to the Old English Sheepdog. <br>They are large dogs, 
                    with their most distinctive feature being their heavy matted cords, which can reach around 25 cm in length each. The 
                    fur has a further internal layer, which is much softer than the cords. In total, these two layers sum to the heaviest
                    fur of the canine world. Traditionally, this fur was thick enough to protect to dogs from wolf bites, which made them 
                    invaluable protection for the livestock. Once wet, the coat takes three days to dry properly. <br>The dogs themselves 
                    weigh around 50 kg, with a broad head. They tend to be fairly calm and stable, but in times of stress will act 
                    independently of their owners. They are fiercely protective of their home and family, and can hold down 
                    intruders until the owners arrive. <br>
                    In 2020, there were 0 registrations with the UK Kennel Club. <br><br><br>

                    <br>
                    Otterhounds are a British scent hound – they can track a scent through mud and water for over three days. As the name
                    suggests, this breed was for hunting otters, which makes them able to carry their quarry through water or on land. 
                    They have a very oily double coat and extremely webbed feet, with a large head and very sensitive nose. This sensitive
                    nose makes them inquisitive, and so are in general fairly tractable, though once they get an interesting scent they are 
                    hard to discourage. <br>They were first referenced in writings in 1360, although a distinct breed can only be traced 
                    back to the early 1800s. Otter hunting was never outright banned in the UK, but the otter hunts voluntarily stopped
                    when they noticed the severe decline in otter population. They then notified the authorities, who placed the otter on
                    the list of protected species in 1978. As the Otterhounds had been so selectively bred for their hunting 
                    capabilities, few of them were suitable as companions, and so their population declined very quickly. Because of this,
                    the Kennel Club have registered the breed as a vulnerable native breed, with only 600 animals worldwide. <br>
                    They live for around 10 years. They can handle considerable exercise but will often be very happy in an unhealthy 
                    state of laziness. This breed is relatively prone to epilepsy and seizures, which are usually fatal. <br>
                    There were 7 registrations of Otterhounds in the UK with the Kennel Club in 2020.<br><br><br></td>

                    <br>
                    This breed of terrier was developed in Australia from UK exports of Yorkshire terriers. The breed was established by 
                    the end of the 19th century. They are small, compact and short legged, with a distinctive coat of long grey or tan 
                    silk, typically styled hanging straight down and parted down the back. The coat is usually described as “flat, fine, 
                    and glossy”. These dogs were bred originally for hunting rodents and snakes, before quickly becoming more of a pet. 
                    The breed standard for these dogs is very alert and active, requiring a lot of stimulation and exercise. They are 
                    intelligent dogs, but tend to be stubborn and wilful, which makes training quite difficult. They are independent, but 
                    loyal to their owners, and so bark often at incoming strangers. <br>
                    Because of their coat, they require a lot of grooming. They are also particularly prone to dry and itchy skin, and 
                    the use of a harness (as opposed to a choke lead) is encouraged, to prevent tracheal collapse.<br>
                    There were 4 registrations of Australian Silky Terrier with the UK Kennel Club in 2020.
